I am a JSPS postdoc at Kobe University.

I am working in the field of Differential Geometry, focusing on constant mean curvature
surfaces. I use Weierstrass-type representations coming from Integrable Systems methods
to construct new examples of minimal and CMC surfaces in various spaces
and study some of their global properties such as embeddedness.
