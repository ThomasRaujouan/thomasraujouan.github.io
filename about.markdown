I am a JSPS postdoc at Kobe University.

I am working in the field of Differential Geometry, focusing on constant mean curvature
surfaces. I use Weierstrass-type representations coming from Integrable Systems methods
to construct new examples of minimal and CMC surfaces in various spaces
and study some of their global properties such as embeddedness or Willmore energy.
