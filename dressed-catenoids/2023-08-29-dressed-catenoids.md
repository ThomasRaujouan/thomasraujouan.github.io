Joint work with Nick Schmitt and Jonas Ziefle.

These are minimal surfaces in the Euclidean space $$\mathbb{E}^3$$ and CMC 1 surfaces in the hyperbolic space $$\mathbb{H}^3$$. They are made using the Loop Weierstrass Representation. 

Key bindings:
- NUMPAD: hide/show piece. Press 0 to show them all
- SPACE: put the camera back to its original position

## Euclidean space 

### No planar end

No planar end is the plain catenoid.

### 1 planar end

This case is tricky as it is made from the double cover of a catenoid.

- [Vertical][e31v]
- Tilted (todo)

### 2 planar ends

- [Vertical][e32v]
- [Tilted][e32d]

### 3 planar ends

- [Vertical][e33v]
- Tilted (todo)

## Hyperbolic space

The surfaces are displayed in the Poincar√© ball model of $$\mathbb{H}^3$$.

### No planar end

No planar end is the plain catenoid. But in the hyperbolic space, they come in a one-parameter family: (todo)

- Embedded, large neck
- Embedded, thin neck
- Touching horospheres
- Non-embedded, thin neck
- Non-embedded, large neck

### 1 planar end

This case is tricky as it is made from the double cover of a catenoid.

- [Vertical][h3v]
- Tilted (todo)

### 2 planar ends (todo)

- Vertical
- Tilted

### 3 planar ends (todo)

- Vertical
- Tilted

## Extras

- [Dressed helicoid][helicoid]
- [Dressed Enneper][enneper]
