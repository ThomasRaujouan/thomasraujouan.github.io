# Lorentzian space viewer

## Minimal example

*This step is a boilerplate.*

1. **DONE** Import a simple minimal surface with threejs (no texture)

I imported from confs/my-confs/tours/dressed-helicoid. 




## Maximal example

*At the end of this step, I can share the pictures.*

1. **DONE** Replace the surface data by a maxface
    - Compute the surface in Mathematica
    - Export as obj
    - Run through the python script that computes smooth normals
    - import the .obj here
2. Draw the null cone
3. Put a conformal texture

## Lorentz boosts

*This is for moving the surface in Minkowski space with the mouse.*

1. Remove from threejs all that is not necessary. Keep the mouse controls
2. Implement rigid motions in minkowski space.
    - Needs projective geometry in higher dimension (Light cone model)?


## Tesselation shader

*It's possible that one needs to refine as a Lorentz boost is applied.*
