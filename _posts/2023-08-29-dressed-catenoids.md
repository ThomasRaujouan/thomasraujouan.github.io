Joint work with N. Schmitt.

# 2 planar ends

- Symmetric: [full][2vfull] -- [half 1][2vhalf1] -- [half 2][2vhalf2].
- Non-symmetric: [full][2dfull] -- [half 1][2dhalf1]

 <!-- -- [half 2][2dhalf2] is broken -->

# 3 planar ends

- Symmetric: [full][3vfull] -- [3rd 1][3v3rd1] -- [3rd 2][3v3rd2].
- Non-symmetric: [full][3dfull]
